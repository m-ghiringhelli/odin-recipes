  <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>In addition to being a hot-shot web developer, I am also a comptent 
      cook. These are recipes I developed and perfected over ten years of 
      being vegan. I am no longer vegan, but these are still the recipes 
      I like to whip up on a cold winter evening here in rainy Portland, 
      Oregon. Common themes include starches, peanut butter, and the 
      culinary mircale known as Field Roast sausage.</p>
