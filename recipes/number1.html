      <h1>Number 1</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This dish is known as "Number 1" because at one point in time I was
          eating it at least three days a week and it was the most frequent
          thing I cooked. It developed slowly over many iterations into the dish
          you see before you. It's vaguely reminiscent of a Thai peanut sauce
          noodle dish but much more Americanized and bastardized. The peanut 
          butter lends it a creamy texture while the soy sauce gives it a lot of
          umami.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>Slice the Field Roast thinly, on a bias</li>
          <li>Mince the garlic and chop the onion</li>
          <li>Cut the broccoli crowns off the stems and seperate the crowns into bite-sized pieces</li>
          <li>Peel the stems and cut them into bite-sized pieces</li>
          <li>Chop the red pepper and slice the mushrooms</li>
          <li>Boil water in a large pot, adding a heaping chunk of salt</li>
          <li>Warm a small pan on medium heat</li>
          <li>When the pan is hot, add some oil and let it warm up</li>
          <li>When the oil is hot, add the sliced Field Roast, stirring occasionally</li>
          <li>In a separate pot, heat oil and add garlic</li>
          <li>As the garlic warms, add the onion</li>
          <li>Once the onion starts to become transparent, add the broccoli stems</li>
          <li>After the broccoli stems have cooked a little, add the crowns</li>
          <li>When the broccoli has softened a little, add the peppers and mushrooms</li>
          <li>Add the cooked Field Roast to the pot of vegetables and keep warm on low heat</li>
          <li>When the pot is boiling, add the pasta</li>
          <li>After several minutes, taste the pasta. When it is still a little crunchy (just before al dente), drain while reserving a small amount of the pasta water</li>
          <li>Combine the pasta, reserved pasta water, and the pot of vegetables and Field Roast</li>
          <li>Add a heaping gob of peanut butter (seriously, way more than you probably think), a fair amount of soy sauce, and a healthy dash of rice vinegar</li>
          <li>Continue to stir and simmer on medium heat until enough water has boiled off that the sauce appears thick</li>
          <li>Let cool and enjoy your first number 1!</li>
        </ol>
